# symbols-tree-view-fix package

**Disclaimer:** this package has been forked from https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-view. I am not the original author. Source code is the same, but will try to keep deprecation warnings fixed asap.
Another forked package is available at https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-nav, what adds new options. May be more experimental! (Do not enable both packages in the same time)

The rest of this README will remain untouched.

Symbols Tree View for Atom.io, just like taglist or tagbar for VIM.

tag-generator.coffee comes from http://github.com/atom/symbols-view
