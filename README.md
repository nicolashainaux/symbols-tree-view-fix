# symbols-tree-view-fix package

Forked from https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-view. I am not the original author. Source code is the same, but will try to keep deprecation warnings fixed asap.
Another forked package is available at https://atom.io/packages/symbols-tree-nav, what adds new options. May be more experimental!

The rest of this README will remain untouched.

Symbols Tree View for Atom.io, just like taglist or tagbar for VIM.

tag-generator.coffee comes from http://github.com/atom/symbols-view
